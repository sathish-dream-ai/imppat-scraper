**GitHub README Summary: Layman & Technical Explanation**

**ðŸŒ± For the Public (Layman Terms)**

**What This Project Does:**

This code is like a robot that visits the IMPPAT website, a database of Indian medicinal plants, and collects detailed chemical information (like molecular structures called SMILES) for every plant listed.

**Why Itâ€™s Useful:**

Scientists or students studying medicinal plants can use this data to research natural compounds for drug discovery, education, or conservation.

**How It Works:**

The robot processes plants in groups (batches of 500) to avoid overwhelming the website.

For each plant, it grabs all chemical data and saves it neatly into a spreadsheet (CSV).

It politely retries if the website is busy or a page is missing.

**ðŸ’» For Developers (Technical Terms)**
**What This Code Achieves:**

An asynchronous Python scraper built with HTTPX and BeautifulSoup that systematically extracts phytochemical metadata (SMILES, InChI, etc.) from IMPPAT.

**Key Features:**

Batch Processing: Processes ~4010 plants in batches (default: 500) to balance speed and server load.

Concurrency Control: Limits parallel requests using semaphores (MAX_CONCURRENT_PH = 5) to avoid throttling.

Robust Error Handling: Retries failed requests with exponential backoff and skips invalid URLs (HTTP 404).

Data Export: Outputs structured data to a CSV file using polars for efficiency.

**Technical Workflow:**

Fetch Plant Links: Scrapes the plant drop-down menu and sorts entries alphabetically.

Parse Plant Pages: For each plant, extracts all phytochemical detail page links.

Extract Chemical Data: From each phytochemical page, retrieves SMILES, InChI, InChIKey, and DeepSMILES.

Batch Processing: Uses asyncio.gather to process plants concurrently within batches.
